<h2 style="font-size: 40px;"> The Inner Peace Needed for Teate Therapy </h2> 

 <p>
<h2>
<br> When we focus on the present moment, feel gratitude for what we have, let go of self-centered attachments, keep our hearts open, and embrace intuition and synchronicity, the bluebird of happiness—true inner peace—naturally comes to our side.
</h2>
</p>
<p>
To achieve such inner peace, consider the following thoughts and actions:
<br><br>
• Do not dwell on the past or worry about the future. Instead, appreciate and savor the blessings you have right now. This mindset can keep you happy throughout your life, because as long as you are alive, there are always some blessings present.

<br><br>
• When you feel unfairly treated, take a moment to reflect. You are sustained by countless gifts from nature—your heart beats, you breathe, you move, you think. These are miracles granted to you, far surpassing any misfortune.
</p>

• All living beings share the same origin—if we trace back through generations, we all return to the first life form. Similarly, everything that exists in the universe shares the same source—going back in time, we all originate from the birth of the universe. The ultimate origin of everything is one. The sense of separation between self and others is an illusion born from ego. Diminishing this illusion—by letting go of self-centeredness—leads to enlightenment and brings us closer to happiness.

<br><br>
• We live in three realms:
1.The physical world we can see, hear, and touch (the 3D world),
2.The realm of thoughts, desires, and attachments (the brain’s world), and
3.The intuitive world (the soul’s world, aligned with the laws of the universe).
The further back the realm, the higher the dimension. Valuing the highest—intuition—is the key to living rightly and happily, for it aligns us with the laws governing the entire universe.

<br><br>
• Relaxing the mind leads to relaxation in the body, resulting in better health. Relaxing the body also calms the mind, leading to happiness. In short, easing either the body or the mind brings both health and happiness.

<br><br>
• When you let go of self-centeredness, you automatically tune into the will of the universe. Then, your own thoughts become aligned with that will, and the world unfolds according to your desires.

<br><br>
• The driving force of life comes from feeling that you are contributing to something beyond yourself.

<br><br>
• Releasing self-centered attachments can sometimes be very difficult—because those attachments themselves resist being removed. In such cases, stop thinking and focus solely on relaxing your body. As you do, natural energy will begin to flow through your body and mind, and self-centeredness will naturally diminish.

<br><br>
• The world around you is, in truth, a reflection of your own awareness. The world you perceive is shaped by your consciousness. If you perceive it as peaceful and happy, that is the world you live in. Even if something seems otherwise, if you believe it will eventually become something positive, then even that event is part of a peaceful, happy world. Time always brings change, and if you always envision things becoming better, then everything becomes part of a happy world. Like attracts like—this is often referred to as the law of attraction—and eventually, even seemingly negative events disappear, leaving only elements of a peaceful and happy world.
